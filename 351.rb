# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a Plant class with attributes and reader/writer methods for name, size, and price. Then write a method that prints out the attributes in a single sentence.

class Plant
    attr_reader :name, :size, :price
    attr_writer :name, :size, :price

    def initialize(name, size, price)
        @name = name
        @size = size
        @price = price
    end

    def info
        pp "name: #{name}, size: #{size}, : price: #{price}"
    end

end

plant = Plant.new("pretty", 45.3, 45)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
