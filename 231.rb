# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. i got confused between pre existing methods that go with strings, and creating class's instead of creating methods


# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times two. Then run the method and print the result

def double_num(number)
    return number *2
end

pp double_num(5)
