# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Make a hash to store a person's first name, last name, and email address. Then print each attribute on separate lines

person = {"first_name" => "ayala", "last_name" => "karfunkel", "email" => "ayalakarf@gmail.com"}
pp person["first_name"]
pp person["last_name"]
pp person["email"]




# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no, needed to look at the solution
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. i forgot what sign to use, i was usting = instead of =>, im going to practice the rest of these questions from arrays-hashes-2
