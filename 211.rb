# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.

#Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

age = 77
    if age > 80
        puts 5
    elsif age > 60
        puts 4
    elsif age > 40
        puts 3
    elsif age > 20
        puts 2
    else
        puts 1
    end


#  Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?  yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. loops
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
