Hi! My names Ayala Karfunkel. I grew up in Toronto, Ontario and still live here today! I finished High School three years ago and have been deciding what to study ever since. I finally decided at the end of last year to learn computer coding! I made that decision because I have a very logical brain, but a very creative one as well. I am hoping that web development will give me the oppurtunity to use both of those strengths and build a good career for myself.
